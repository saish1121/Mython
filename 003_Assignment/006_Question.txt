Q6 . What is Dictionary in Python? Explain Key-Value Pair Why Key Must Be Immutable? Why Duplicate Key Are Not Allowed?

#Solution------------

    What is a Dictionary in Python?

    A dictionary in Python is a collection that stores data in the form of key–value pairs.
    Each key is used to identify a value
    Data is accessed using keys, not index numbers
    Dictionaries are:
    Mutable
    Unordered (logically; insertion order preserved in modern Python)

    Example:
        student = {
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 21,
        "course": "Python"
    }


    What is a Key–Value Pair?

    A key–value pair means:
    key : value

    Example:
    "name" : "Alice"

    Key → Identifier (like a label)
    Value → Actual data

    Accessing value:
    print(student["name"])


    Output:
    Alice


    Why must dictionary keys be immutable?
    Short Answer (Interview):
    Dictionary keys must be immutable because Python uses hashing to store and retrieve values efficiently.

    Explanation (Step-by-Step)
    Python dictionaries are implemented using a hash table

    Each key:

    Is passed to a hash function
    Produces a fixed hash value
    This hash value decides:
    Where the key–value pair is stored in memory
    If a key were mutable:
    Its value could change
    Its hash would change
    Python would lose track of the value


    Why are duplicate keys NOT allowed?
    Short Answer (Interview):
    Duplicate keys are not allowed because each key must uniquely identify a value in the dictionary.
    Easy Explanation
    Dictionary works like a real-life dictionary
    One word → one meaning
    If duplicate keys were allowed:
    Python wouldn’t know which value to return
