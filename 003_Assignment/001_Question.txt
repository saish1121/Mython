Q1. What is the difference between list and tuple in Python? 
    Explain in terms of mutability, memory, performance, and use case.

#Solution-------

        Feature	        List	            Tuple

        Mutability	    Mutable	            Immutable
        Memory	        More	            Less
        Performance	    Slower          	Faster
        Syntax	        [ ]	                ( )
        Use Case	    Dynamic data	    Fixed data


    List(Mutable)
    Elements can be changed, added, or removed

            Input:
                lst = [1, 2, 3]
                lst[0] = 10
                print(lst)


            Output:            
                [10, 2, 3]

    Tuple(Immutable)
    Elements cannot be changed after creation

            Input:
                tup = (1, 2, 3)
                tup[0] = 10   # Error


            Error:
                TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment


    Memory Usage
    Tuple uses less memory than list
    Reason:
    Tuple is immutable → no extra space for resizing
    List keeps extra memory for add/remove operations
    Example (conceptual):
    List  → more memory
    Tuple → less memory
    Tuple is more memory-efficient.

    Performance (Speed)
    Tuple is faster than list
    Reason:
    Fixed size
    No dynamic changes
    Faster iteration and access
    Especially noticeable in:
    Iteration

    Use Case (When to use what?)
    Use List when:
    Data needs to be modified
    Size changes frequently
    Example:
            shopping_cart = ["apple", "banana"]
            shopping_cart.append("orange")

    Use Tuple when:
    Data should be constant
    No modification required
    Used as dictionary keys

    Example:
            coordinates = (10, 20)
            days=(mon,tue,wed,thur,fri,sat)




                        Tuple	                                                                       List
Immutable – once created, elements cannot be changed	                            Mutable – elements can be changed, added, or removed
Uses less memory because size is fixed	                                            Uses more memory to support dynamic resizing
Faster in execution and iteration	                                                Slower compared to tuple
Written using ( ) parentheses	                                                    Written using [ ] square brackets
Suitable for fixed / constant data	                                                Suitable for dynamic / changeable data
Can be used as dictionary keys	                                                    Cannot be used as dictionary keys
Safer for data that should not be modified	                                        Better when frequent updates are required
