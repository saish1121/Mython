Q2. Why tuple is faster than list in which real world scenario would you prefer tuple over list


#Solution-----------------


    Reason 1: Immutability
    Tuple is immutable (cannot change after creation)
    List is mutable (can grow, shrink, change)
    Because tuples never change:
    Python does not need extra checks
    No resizing or reallocation of memory
    This makes tuple operations faster.

    Reason 2: Memory Allocation
    Tuple has fixed size
    List keeps extra memory for future insertions

    Example:

    List over-allocates space
    Tuple allocates exactly what is needed
    Less memory = faster access.

    Reason 3: Simpler Internal Structure
    Tuple has a simpler C-level structure

    List has extra logic for:
    append
    insert
    remove
    Fewer operations = faster execution.

    Reason 4: Faster Iteration & Access
    Iterating over a tuple is slightly faster
    Index access is also faster than list
    Especially noticeable in large data and loops.


    Real-World Scenarios: When to prefer Tuple over List
    Scenario 1: Fixed data (Should not change)
    DAYS = ("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri")


    Days should not be modified
    Tuple protects data integrity
