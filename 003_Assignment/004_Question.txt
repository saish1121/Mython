Q4 .Explain why string are immutable in python what happened internally when you modify a string variable

#Solution---------------

    Why are strings immutable in Python?
    Strings are immutable in Python because once a string object is created, its characters cannot be changed.
    Simple reasons:
    Safety – string values should not change accidentally
    Efficiency – Python can reuse strings in memory
    Performance – faster operations like hashing and caching

    What does “immutable” mean (easy words)?
    You cannot change a string after it is created
    You can create a new string, but you cannot modify the old one
