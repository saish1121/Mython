Q8. What is the range data type in Python?
    How is it different from a list of numbers?

#Solution------------

    Range is a built-in data type that represents a sequence of numbers 
    generated on demand.

    r = range(1, 6)
    Generates numbers from 1 to 5
    Does not store all values in memory 


    Difference Between range and list

Feature	            range	                          list
Data type	        Range object	                  List
Memory usage	    Less (lazy evaluation)	          More (stores all values)
Mutability	        Immutable	                      Mutable
Stores values	    No (generates when needed)	      Yes
Performance	        Faster for iteration	          Slower
Syntax	            range(1, 6)	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
