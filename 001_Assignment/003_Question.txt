Q. What does the id() Function return ?
Is the value returned by id() same for two variables holding the same value?

#Solution....
id() is same only if both variable reference the same object,
Because Variable are just lables painting to object.
Object carry the type information,not variable,
    
    x = 5
    y = 5
    object knows - 5 is an interger 
    variable - just lables the object

Object holds the type information and thats the reason 
it is store on same memory address and return the same value.
