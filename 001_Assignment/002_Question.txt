Q2.What is different Between 


# Problem.......

A . 

    a = 10 
    b = 10

B .

    a = [10]
    b = [10]


# Hint ........
(Exlpain using Id())


# Solution ........

The Id() function returns the memory address of an object,
That helps to understand how Python Manages Memory and Object reference.

# Difference ......

A .

    a = 10
    b = 10 

Reuse immutable(Cant change) objects both variables point to the same objest,
Will store at same memory address.
(Object is 10 that carry the type information so it will remain at same location)

B .

    a = [ 10 ]
    b = [ 10 ]

As we can see value is store in form of list,
List are mutable(Can be change) will allocated separatelly,
Will store the value at different memory address.
