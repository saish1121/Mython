# What will be the Output

# print("10" + "20")
# At first as we can see the 10 and 20 is in double inverted quamas, 
# So the 10 and 20 will consedered as string and it will concadinate 
# Output - "1020"


# print(10 + 20)
# At first as we can seen the 10 and 20 are not in double inverted quamas, 
# So the 10 and 20 will consedered as integers and it will add the values 
# Output - 30
