Q6 .Python is called a dynamic type language. 
    Explain this with a short code explanation.

#Solution-------------

    Python is a dynamically typed language because variable types are decided at runtime, 
    and the same variable can hold values of different data types during execution without 
    explicit type declaration.


                    Input:
                        x = 5        # x refers to an integer
                            print(type(x))

                        x = "Hello" # x now refers to a string
                            print(type(x))


                    Output:
                        <class 'int'>
                        <class 'str'>


    Dynamic vs Static (One Line)
            int x = 5;    // static typing (C)
            x = "Hi";    // error

            x = 5
            x = "Hi"     # valid (dynamic typing)
