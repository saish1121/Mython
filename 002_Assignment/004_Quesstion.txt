Q4. Python is compile language or interpreter Langauge?

    Python is an interpreted language, but internally it uses a compiler. 
    The Python compiler first compiles the entire source code into bytecode. 
    This bytecode is then executed instruction by instruction by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM), 
    which is part of the interpreter.
