Q8 . What do you understand by indentation specific language? 

#Solution -----------

    An indentation-specific language is a language where indentation (spaces or tabs at the beginning of a line) is used to define the structure and blocks of code.

    In such languages:
    Indentation decides which statements belong together
    There are no curly braces { } to define blocks
    Python is an indentation-specific language



            if True:
            print("Inside if block")
            print("Still inside if block")

        print("Outside if block")
        
        (Lines with same indentation belong to the same block.)
