Q5 . What is the purpose of __pycache__ Folder ?


#Solution ---------
    The main purpose of the __pycache__ folder is to store compiled bytecode (.pyc files)
    so that Python can reuse it in future executions and avoid recompiling the source code. 
    The Python Virtual Machine executes bytecode instruction by instruction, 
    whether it is loaded from memory or from the __pycache__ folder.
