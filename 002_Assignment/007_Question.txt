Q7 . Explain why Python is considered as platform independent and portable.


# Solution ------------

    Python is platform independent because the same source code (.py file) 
    can run on different operating systems without modification, 
    provided the appropriate Python interpreter is available on each platform.


    Python is portable because Python programs can be transferred and executed across 
    different platforms with minimal or no changes.

    Portability comes from:
    Standardized language syntax
    Same behavior across platforms
    Interpreter abstraction
