Q3. What is a byte code in Python?
    Where it is stored and why does Python use it?


# Solution ---------------

    In Python, the compiler is present inside the interpreter. 
    The compiler converts the human-readable source code (.py file) into bytecode, 
    which is understandable by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). 
    The PVM then executes this bytecode to produce the output.

                            .py (Human readable code)
                                        ↓
                                Python Compiler
                                        ↓
                                Bytecode (.pyc)
                                        ↓
                                Python Virtual Machine (PVM)
                                        ↓
                                Output

    ----------------------------------

    Python bytecode is stored in a .pyc file inside the __pycache__ directory.


    Python:

    Compiles example.py into bytecode
    Saves it as a .pyc file


    -----------------------------------

    Python uses bytecode to make program execution faster and platform-independent.

    Reason 1: Faster Execution 
    First time:
    .py → bytecode (takes time)
    Next time:
    Python directly loads .pyc
    Skips compilation
    This reduces startup time
    Reason 2: Platform Independent 
    Bytecode is same on all OS
    PVM converts bytecode → machine code
    Same .pyc can run on:
    Windows    
    Linux
    macOS    
    (as long as Python version matches)
    Reason 3: Easier for PVM to Understand
    PVM does not understand Python syntax
    It understands bytecode instructions only
