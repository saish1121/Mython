Q1. What are bytes in Python? Why are they immutable?

#Solution ---------------

    bytes represent a sequence of binary data (0–255)

    Commonly used for:
    Files
    Images
    Network data
    b = b'ABC'

Why bytes are immutable?

    Once created, byte data cannot be changed
    Ensures:
    Data safety
    Faster processing
    Consistent behavior in low-level operations
