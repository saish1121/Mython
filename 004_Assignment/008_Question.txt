Q8 . What are set in python?

#Solution----------

A set is an unordered, mutable collection that stores unique values only.
No duplicates
No indexing
Very fast lookup

s = {10, 20, 30}

Why sets remove duplicates?

Internally uses hashing
Same value → same hash → stored once

(Sets automatically remove duplicates because they are hash-based)
