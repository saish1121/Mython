Q10 . How does Python manage memory automatically?


#Solution-------

    Python automatically allocates memory when an object is created
    Python automatically frees memory when an object is no longer needed

This is done using:

    Garbage Collection
    Reference Counting

Why programmer doesn’t need to free memory?

    Python takes care of memory management internally
    Programmer focuses only on logic, not memory

Example:
    a = 10
    a = 20


Memory of 10 is released automatically if not used


(Python uses automatic memory management through garbage collection, so programmers do not need to allocate or free memory manually)
