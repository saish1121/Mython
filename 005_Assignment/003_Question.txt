Q3. Predict the output
        Code:
            def fun():
                x = 10
                print(x)

            fun()
            print(x)

#Solution-------

        Output:
            10
            Error

Reason:

    x = 10 is inside the function, so it is a local variable

    Local variables work only inside the function
    print(x) outside the function cannot access it
    
    (Variables defined inside a function are local and cannot be accessed outside the function.)
