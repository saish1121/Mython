Q8. Why does this code work without declaration?

            Code:
            x = 100


#Solution---------

    In Python, no need to declare variable type
    Python automatically decides the data type at runtime
    Here x becomes an integer automatically

Compare with C / Java:

    C / Java
    int x = 100;


    Python
    x = 100


(Python does not require variable declaration because it is dynamically typed.)
