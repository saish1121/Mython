Q1 . What is a user-defined function?

#Solution------------

    A user-defined function is a function that is created by the programmer to perform a specific task.
    It helps to reuse code, reduce repetition, and make the program easy to read.

    Example:
    def multiply(a, b):
        return a * b


Here:

    multiply is a user-defined function
    It accepts two numbers
    It returns their multiplication


(A user-defined function is a function written by the user to perform a particular task and can be reused multiple times)
