Q9 . Difference between
        x = 10
        x = "Ten"

Is this allowed?

#Solution--------

    Yes, it is allowed

Why?

    Python allows changing the data type of a variable
    The variable x first stores an integer
    Then it stores a string

Important word:
    (Dynamic typing)


(In Python, the same variable can hold different data types because Python is dynamically typed.)
